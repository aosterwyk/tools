This repo is a collection of various scripts/tools. There's some overlap with my [unorganized list of gists](https://gist.github.com/aosterwyk).

This repo uses directories to keep things organized. Everything can be used standalone unless the file says otherwise. You do not need to download or keep every script in a directory to use an individual script. 

## Installation

Clone the repo or download individual files. 

## Usage

Each file has comments with instructions.
